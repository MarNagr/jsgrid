grid.js
======

[grid.js](http://flack.github.io/grid.js/) is a jQuery plugin for displaying and manipulating tabular data. It is a fork of jqGrid, or to be more specific, a fork of the last version before the licence change. Now you could argue that the licence change was invalid, since Trirand did not get permission of all the copyright holders and continue using it under the old licence, but this is really an inconvenient situation unless you're looking for a fight.

So as an alternative, the MIT/GPL-licenced version is available in this repo. It is currently a work in progress, so  the [documentation/website](http://flack.github.io/grid.js/) is very incomplete (but since the code is unchanged, the original jqGrid documentation and demos can be used).

The idea is to turn this repo into a community-driven and free version of jqGrid. To facilitate this, we've switched to Grunt as it is much more common and easier to handle, and we'll keep documentation in the repo itself so it can be managed with Github workflows.

Enjoy!
