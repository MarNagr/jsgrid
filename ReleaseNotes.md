Release notes
=============

1.0
---

1.0 is the first release of grid.js. The following are the important changes since jqGrid 4.7.

* Updated locales to use standard ISO language codes - this leads to the following changes:
** For Chinese (Mainland China or Simplified) grid.locale-cn.js becomes grid.locale-zh-CN.js
** For Chinese (Taiwan or Traditional) grid.locale-tw.js becomes grid.locale-zh-TW.js
** For Korean grid.locale-kr.js becomes grid.locale-ko.js
** For Portuguese (Brazil) grid.locale-pt-br.js becomes grid.locale-pt-BR.js
** For Ukrainian grid.locale-ua.js becomes grid.locale-uk.js

If you've added any custom code to handle the incorrect language codes you'll need to remove this for this release.
